# A Philosophy of Life

> **Philosophy**, from the Ancient Greek words '*philos'* (love) and *'sophia'* (wisdom), means *"love of wisdom."* 

It involves the study of fundamental questions about existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. In its most practical form, philosophy is a tool that shapes how one understands the world and guides one’s actions.

**A philosophy of life** is a coherent set of beliefs and principles that informs and guides an individual's choices, priorities, and actions throughout life, providing a framework for understanding and interacting with the world.

**Having a philosophy of life is not optional —  everyone has a 'philosophy' by which they live, consciously or not, making a philosophy of life inevitable and essential. [^hadot]**

We all live according to certain goals and values. These may not be clear to you, meaning that you are more likely to be influenced by other people.

Having a meaningful life requires having a grand goal for living.  The definition of *grand goal for living* is the goal that, above all others, _you would not sacrifice for anything else.

This grand goal serves as the foundation of a well-developed philosophy of life, guiding our choices, actions, and priorities.

So a philosophy of life defines what we want _out_ of life, rather than merely what we want _in_ life. [^irvine]

In other words, a philosophy of life is not just about accumulating possessions, achievements, or experiences. These are things we want *in* life, not *out* of life. 

It is about identifying the deeper purpose and meaning that we seek to derive from our existence. It involves asking fundamental questions such as: 

- What kind of person do I want to be? 
- What values do I want to embody? 
- How can I make a positive difference in the world?

Developing a philosophy of life is a deeply personal process requiring introspection, self-reflection, and a willingness to challenge our assumptions and beliefs. It means taking an honest look at our strengths, weaknesses, passions, and fears, and using these insights to craft a vision for the kind of life we want to lead.

A well-defined philosophy provides a sense of direction and purpose, even in the face of adversity or uncertainty. With a clear understanding of what matters to us, we are better equipped to take difficult decisions, overcome obstacles, and stay aligned to our values. 

Decisions, and life, become easier. 

A philosophy of life is not a fixed set of rules — it evolves as we grow and change. 

As we navigate through different stages and experiences of life, our values, priorities, and goals may shift. Our philosophy of life must adapt accordingly.

**Ultimately, developing a philosophy of life is about having an active and intentional approach to living.** It is moving beyond the default settings of societal expectations and external pressures, and instead charting our own course based on what we believe to be true, meaningful, and fulfilling. By doing so, we create the conditions for a life that is rich in purpose, joy, and personal growth.
