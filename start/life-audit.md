## Define Your Present Self.

Who are you?

This may seem a strange question. Of course you know who you are — but sometimes it is easier for other people to view you objectively than it is for yourself.

This is why setting dedicated time aside to ask yourself who you are is important. You’ll gain clarity. 

Take a piece of paper, or write on your computer. Ensure you have 30-60 minutes of uninterrupted time, and then answer these questions:

1. Do you feel happy?
2. What has been my greatest success?
3. What is the most important life lesson I have ever learned? 
4. What am I most ashamed of?
5. If money were no object, how would you spend your time?
6. If you could go back and change one decision in your life, what would it be and why?
7. What are you most grateful for in your life?
8. When was the last time you did something for the first time? What was it, and how did it make you feel?
9. If you could have a conversation with your younger self, what advice would you give?
