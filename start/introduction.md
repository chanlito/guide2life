Drawing from a wide range of disciplines, including philosophy, [evolutionary psychology](/start/brain-meets-world), health sciences, and personal development, Guide2Life offers a structured approach to understanding and optimizing various aspects of your life. Whether you're seeking to [lose weight](/health/losing-weight), build stronger relationships, make better decisions, or [find a deeper sense of purpose](/start/philosophy-of-life), this guide will provide you with practical strategies and insights to help you along the way.

## Rationale
> "The unexamined life is not worth living." **Socrates.**

Guide2Life was created to fill a significant gap: **a well-organized, trustworthy resource for living well.**

Many individuals struggle to find proper guidance, relying on trial and error to navigate personal and professional challenges.

The information found here is widely available, but fragmented across various sources and lacks structure, which complicates the search for dependable advice. For instance, you can check out how recommended books, blogs, and videos for other excellent content online. 

However, there are a lot of actors with misaligned incentives that want to profit from the various struggles that individuals face in their lives.  The abundance of self-help resources in the digital age can also lead to confusion and difficulty distinguishing evidence-based advice from opinion, speculation, and click-bait.

School has not filled the gap. Traditional education systems focus on academic subjects like math and geography but but not the art of conversation, how to make critical decisions, or cook a healthy meal. 

**Guide2Life addresses these challenges by curating and synthesizing the best available evidence from various disciplines.** 

>[!TIP] Guide2Life was made because we needed it!
Our  founder has [explored these topics extensively on his blog for over a decade.](https://emanuele.cc) His insights, though valuable, were sporadic and not always evidence-based. His frustration in seeking a structured manual for how to live well led to the creation of Guide2Life.



The goal is not to prescribe a singular path to a live well lived, but rather to provide a reliable resource for those seeking to live a more intentional, fulfilling, and well-rounded life.

## Evidence-Based
**Guide2Life is based on evidence, not personal opinion.** 

The guide [references peer-reviewed studies and reports from reputable organizations](/editorial-guidelines/referencing) whenever possible. We follow the scientific method — if new evidence emerges that contradicts current findings, the guide will be updated accordingly.

That said, the information here is also based on thousands of discussions with individuals across the world, asking about their experiences, challenges, and insights on living a fulfilling life. 

The content blends scientific research, practical real-world advice, and philosophical wisdom in an accessible format, serving as a reference for specific topics and a starting point for further education.

## Open Source
**All Guide2Life information and systems are freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute.** 

[Guide2Life is also version controlled.](https://guide2life.org) This means that every change, no matter how small, is logged. 

Text on a documentation-style website is the perfect format. Traditional media like YouTube videos, podcasts, books, or PDF reports only show the final product. Updating them with new evidence is often impractical, leading to outdated references. A documentation-style website allows for easy updates, ensuring the information remains accurate and current with the latest research.

This is not to say that Guide2Life is a replacement for all other information sources. We provide recommended videos, podcasts, books, and blogs where you can explore topics further in a more engaging format. 

This approach encourages a collaborative environment where experts and enthusiasts from around the world contribute their knowledge and experiences, enriching the content and ensuring it remains up-to-date and relevant.

The open-source nature of Guide2Life not only promotes transparency but also empowers readers. Readers can adapt the content to better suit their personal needs or even create localized versions that address specific cultural contexts or challenges. 

This level of customization and flexibility is fundamental to the guide’s mission of providing accessible, personalized guidance to as many people as possible.

## Free
**All resources are completely free of charge.**

We believe that high-quality, life-improving knowledge should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their economic situation.

The free access to Guide2Life supports the principle that personal growth and educational opportunities should not be commodified. It aligns with our core belief that empowering individuals to lead better lives leads to a better world. As users benefit from the guide without financial constraints, they are more likely to contribute back to the platform or help others in their journey, creating a virtuous cycle of learning and sharing.

## Personal Responsibility
**Ultimately, you are responsible for your life.**  

Guide2Life provides guidance and evidence-based recommendations, but you should do what’s best for you and take responsibility for your choices and actions. Adapt the advice to your unique situations and make decisions based on your personal values and goals. 

When in doubt, speak to an expert.
