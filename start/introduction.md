# Introduction
Welcome to the Guide2Life, a structured evidence-based approach to get the most out of life. All changes to this guide are [version controlled.](https://github.com/emanuelefaja/howtolive)

**At the core of this guide is the belief that living well is a skill that can be learned and cultivated through intentional effort and practice.**

Drawing from a wide range of disciplines, including psychology, philosophy, health sciences, and personal development, Guide2Life offers a structured approach to understanding and optimizing various aspects of your life. Whether you're seeking to improve your physical health, build stronger relationships, make better decisions, or find a deeper sense of purpose, this guide will provide you with practical strategies and insights to help you along the way.

## Rationale

Modern life presents unique challenges for our 200,000-year-old brains. Our minds, evolved for a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, must now navigate a world of technological advancements, information overload, and rapid societal changes. 

Many individuals struggle to find proper guidance, relying on trial and error to navigate personal and professional challenges. Schools teach us maths and geography, but not the art of conversation or how to make critical decisions. The abundance of self-help resources in the digital age can also lead to confusion and difficulty distinguishing evidence-based advice from opinion, speculation, and click-bait.

Guide2Life addresses these challenges by curating and synthesizing the best available evidence from various disciplines. 

The goal is not to prescribe a singular path to a live well lived, but rather to provide a reliable resource for those seeking to live a more intentional, fulfilling, and well-rounded life, offering a framework for self-discovery and personal growth adaptable to individual circumstances and aspirations.

## Evidence-based Approach
Guide2Life is based on evidence, not personal opinion. The guide references peer-reviewed studies and reports from reputable organizations whenever possible. If new evidence emerges that contradicts current findings, the guide will be updated accordingly.

The content blends scientific research, practical advice, and philosophical wisdom in an accessible format, serving as a reference for specific topics and a starting point for further education.

## Personal Responsibility
Ultimately, individuals are responsible for their own lives and must do what works best for them. Guide2Life provides guidance and evidence-based recommendations, but you should adapt the advice to your unique situations and make decisions based on your personal values and goals.
