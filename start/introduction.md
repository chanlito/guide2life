Drawing from a wide range of disciplines, including philosophy, [evolutionary psychology](/start/brain-meets-world), health sciences, and personal development, Guide2Life offers a structured approach to understanding and optimizing various aspects of your life. Whether you're seeking to improve your physical health, build stronger relationships, make better decisions, or [find a deeper sense of purpose](/start/philosophy-of-life), this guide will provide you with practical strategies and insights to help you along the way.

## Rationale
> "The unexamined life is not worth living." **Socrates.**

Many individuals struggle to find proper guidance, relying on trial and error to navigate personal and professional challenges. Schools teach us maths and geography, but not the art of conversation, how to make critical decisions, or cook a healthy meal. The abundance of self-help resources in the digital age can also lead to confusion and difficulty distinguishing evidence-based advice from opinion, speculation, and click-bait.

**Guide2Life addresses these challenges by curating and synthesizing the best available evidence from various disciplines.** 

The goal is not to prescribe a singular path to a live well lived, but rather to provide a reliable resource for those seeking to live a more intentional, fulfilling, and well-rounded life.

## Evidence-Based
**Guide2Life is based on evidence, not personal opinion.** 

The guide [references peer-reviewed studies and reports from reputable organizations](/editorial-guidelines/referencing) whenever possible. We follow the scientific method — if new evidence emerges that contradicts current findings, the guide will be updated accordingly.

That said, the information here is also based on thousands of discussions with individuals across the world, asking about their experiences, challenges, and insights on living a fulfilling life. 

The content blends scientific research, practical real-world advice, and philosophical wisdom in an accessible format, serving as a reference for specific topics and a starting point for further education.

## Open Source
**All Guide2Life information and systems are freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute.** 

This approach encourages a collaborative environment where experts and enthusiasts from around the world contribute their knowledge and experiences, enriching the content and ensuring it remains up-to-date and relevant.

The open-source nature of Guide2Life not only promotes transparency but also empowers readers. Readers can adapt the content to better suit their personal needs or even create localized versions that address specific cultural contexts or challenges. 

This level of customization and flexibility is fundamental to the guide’s mission of providing accessible, personalized guidance to as many people as possible.

## Free
**All resources are completely free of charge.**

We believe that high-quality, life-improving knowledge should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their economic situation. By removing the cost element, Guide2Life ensures that anyone with the desire to grow and improve can do so without the burden of expense.
