# Introduction
Welcome to the Guide2Life, a structured evidence-based approach to get the most out of life. All changes to this guide are [version controlled for the sake of transparency. ](https://github.com/emanuelefaja/howtolive)

At the core of this guide is the belief that living well is a skill that can be learned and cultivated through intentional effort and practice.

Drawing from a wide range of disciplines, including psychology, philosophy, health sciences, and personal development, Guide2Life offers a structured approach to understanding and optimizing various aspects of your life. Whether you're seeking to improve your physical health, build stronger relationships, make better decisions, or find a deeper sense of purpose, this guide will provide you with practical strategies and insights to help you along the way.

## Rationale. 
The rationale behind this ambitious project is that many of us stumble through life without proper guidance. School may teach us maths and geography, but doesn't teach us how to have a hard conversation or how to make tough decisions. In a world filled with uncertainties and endless possibilities, it can be overwhelming to find the right path to a fulfilling and healthy life. So, creating a comprehensive guide on how to live made sense.

## Evidence-based.

This guide is not based on personal opinion, but on evidence. We reference peer-reviewed studies and reports from reputable organizations where possible. If the evidence changes and points to different conclusions, we will update the findings accordingly. 

Throughout this guide, you'll find a blend of scientific research, practical advice, and philosophical wisdom, all presented in an accessible and engaging format. You can think of this as a reference guide, whenever you have questions about a specific topic or there is something you want to improve, and it can serve as a solid starting point to then educate yourself further.

However, it's essential to remember that your life is your responsibility. 

**You need to do what works for you.**
