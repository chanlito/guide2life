# Writing Style

Our primary goal is to turn knowledge into action.

We must present complex ideas using simple, concise language. So clarity should be at the forefront of every writing decision we make. This makes it easy for readers to understand complicated concepts and apply them their own lives. 

To achieve this clarity, we must write in a friendly, conversational tone that directly addresses the reader. Use the second person ("you") to create a connection with the audience and make the content feel more personal and relevant. When referring to the authors or the team behind the guide, use the first-person plural perspective ("we").

Avoid jargon and technical language whenever possible. When specific terms are necessary, define them clearly. Engage readers by using active voice, short sentences, and clear paragraphs. Proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation are essential for maintaining the guide's professionalism and credibility.

Eliminate unnecessary words and phrases that don't serve the guide's purpose. Every word should count and contribute to conveying the message as directly as possible.
