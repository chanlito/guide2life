# Referencing

Proper referencing is crucial to maintaining the credibility and integrity of the Guide2Life. It ensures that we give credit to the original sources of information and allows readers to explore the research and evidence behind our recommendations.

Note that while there are strict rules on what counts as an acceptable and unacceptable source, *we can still link to blog posts and Youtube videos if they provide useful content for readers*, we just cannot use them to back up points that we make. For instance, it is acceptable to say that [this blog post  ](https://emanuele.cc/harvard-referencing-guide/) and [this 1-minute summary Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVeRlhG9gB8) are useful resources to learn more about Harvard Referencing style. 

## Harvard Style

> [!TIP] Strike a Balance in Referencing
> While referencing is essential, avoid over-referencing to maintain readability for non-academic audiences. Aim to use references strategically to support key points and ideas without overwhelming the reader.

Throughout the guide, we use the Harvard style of referencing, specifically the *Cite Them Right* style. [The Open University has a comprehensive guide on this.](https://www5.open.ac.uk/library/referencing-and-plagiarism/quick-guide-to-harvard-referencing-cite-them-right)

When citing a source within the text, include the author's last name and the year of publication in parentheses, like this: (Smith, 2021). If you are directly quoting a source, also include the page number(s) after the year, like this: (Smith, 2021, p. 45).

> [!TIP] Parenthetical vs Narrative Citation 
> In the Guide2Life, we consistently use parenthetical citations, where the author's last name and the year of publication are placed in parentheses at the end of the sentence or clause, like this: (Smith, 2021). Avoid overusing narrative citations, such as "According to Smith (2021)..." or "Smith (2021) argues that..."
> 
>The reason for this is that parenthetical citations help maintain a more accessible and engaging tone by minimizing the disruption to the flow of the text. This approach prevents the guide from reading like a research paper, making it more appealing and understandable to our target audience.


When citing multiple sources within the same parentheses, list them alphabetically by the first author's last name and separate them with semicolons, like this: (Jones, 2019; Smith, 2021; Taylor, 2020).

At the end of each page or section, include a "References" heading with an H2 tag (## References). Under this heading, list all the sources cited on that page or in that section as bullet points. Each reference should include the author's last name and initials, the year of publication, the title of the work, and the publication details.

Here's an example of how to format a reference for a journal article:

- Smith, J. (2021). The impact of mindfulness on well-being. Journal of Positive Psychology, 16(3), 45-58.

If the source has a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), include it at the end of the reference as a clickable link. While linking to the DOI is advised, it is not necessary if the DOI is not available.

Here's an example of a reference with a DOI link:

- Taylor, S. (2020). The relationship between exercise and mental health. Health Psychology Review, 14(2), 23-35. [https://doi.org/10.1080/17437199.2020.1234567](https://doi.org/10.1080/17437199.2020.1234567)

By following these referencing guidelines, we ensure that the "Guide2Life" is a well-researched, transparent, and reliable resource for our readers.

##  Sources

We prioritize peer-reviewed journals and primary sources. 

### Acceptable Sources

- Peer-reviewed journal articles
- Academic books and book chapters
- Government reports and publications
- Publications from recognized professional organizations (e.g., American Psychological Association, World Health Organization)
- Conference papers and proceedings
- Theses and dissertations

### Unacceptable Sources

While well-established news sources and reputable websites may provide useful information, they often rely on secondary sources or may simplify complex topics for a general audience. To ensure the highest level of accuracy and credibility, we prioritize primary sources and peer-reviewed research. If a news article or website cites a relevant study or report, seek out the original source and cite it directly.

- Personal blogs or websites — regardless of the author. 
- Any news source, including well-established, reputable news sources (e.g., The New York Times, The Guardian)
- Reputable, well-researched websites (e.g., Mayo Clinic, Harvard Health) — take the primary sources instead. 
- Social media posts and comments
- Wikipedia articles (although they can be used to find original sources)
- Self-published books or articles without peer review
- Promotional materials from companies or organizations with a vested interest
- Anecdotal evidence or personal opinions
- Sources with unclear or questionable methodology
- Predatory journals or publishers
- Outdated sources (unless historically relevant)
