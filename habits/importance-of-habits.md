# The Importance of Habits.

> "We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit." 
**Aristotle.**

Regardless of your plans, you can only live one day at a time. Think about this. Everything you do, all the results you achieve, all the relationships you build, are based on your actions today.

This is a large responsibility, and often many days go past where we don’t live in accordance with our principles. Where we end our day with regrets instead of being proud of our achievements. 

Fortunately, we can consider each new day to be an opportunity for a fresh start. 

## Creatures of Habit

Humans are creatures of habits, but it is only in the last fifty years that scientific research has understood just how true this saying is. Everything, literally, changes the shape of your brain. The brain is incredibly flexible, this is what makes human beings so adaptable to almost any situation. 

[x% of our daily actions are on autopilot.] 

This adaptability, and the ability to create and strengthen neural networks and synaptic pathways in the brain is a double edged sword. It can work with us when we compound healthy habits, and against us when, for instance, we get addicted to Fentanyl — a drug that is 50x more potent than Heroin — and we cannot help but seek more.

## The Point of Habits.

The idea behind developing habits is that we create a pattern of behavior that is easy to repeat. We move the behavioral patter from something conscious, to something akin to unconscious behavior. To paraphrase Nike, we “just do it”.
