# What is Wisdom?

Wisdom is the ability to make sound judgments and decisions based on knowledge, experience, and deep understanding, often incorporating ethical considerations and the awareness of the impact on oneself and others.

> [!WARNING]
> Despite its importance,  there is no scientific consensus on wisdom due to its complex meaning and cultural influences. As a result, there are many scientific interpretations of wisdom, each measured differently in studies. This variety complicates the replicability of wisdom research and makes scholarly discussions about wisdom more difficult, which hinders the development of a well-defined science of wisdom.  [^1]

Wisdom can be broken down into two distinct categories:

1. **As Action or Behavior**: Here, wisdom is about taking actions that are well-motivated and altruistically aimed at creatively and successfully solving problems.
2. **As a Psychological Trait**: In this view, wisdom is a broad quality that combines intellectual abilities, knowledge, and experience. It blends virtue and wit, developing through life experiences and continuous practice.


One point that I want to make is that wisdom can solve problems better and faster.
