## Introducton

Alcohol is a poison, and one of the most widely consumed recreational substances on the planet. Even *surprisingly* low alcohol consumption has negative impact on the brain and body. 

That said, drinking clearly has an appeal, otherwise not so many people would do it. 

> BecauseÂ no great storyÂ ever started with someone eating a salad.

This part of Guide2Life is designed to help you understand alcohol and its affects on your health. Then you make an informed decision if you do or do want to drink alcohol as part of your life that fits with your life and health goals. The structure is as follows:

You may decide that the [social benefits of alcohol](#why-drink-alcohol) are worth the health downsides, especially when you drink in moderation. 

Guide2Life is not here to tell you precisely how to live, we purely provide information so you can make the best decisions possible using evidence-based reasoning. 

**However, it is clear in the data and studies that large and regular consumption of alcohol (i.e. "binge drinking") is incompatible with living a good life.**  



## What is Alcohol?

Let's start at the start â€” what, *precisely*, is alcohol?

The alcohol found in drinks such as beer, wine, and spirits is *ethanol*,  a psychoactive substance.

> [!TIP] ðŸ§  What is a Psychoactive Substance?
> A psychoactive substance is a chemical that affects brain function, altering perception, mood, consciousness, or behavior. Examples include alcohol, caffeine, and illicit drugs like cocaine and LSD.

It's produced through fermentation â€” when yeast eats sugar, one of the byproducts is alcohol.

At a chemical level, ethanol consists of two carbon atoms, six hydrogen atoms, and one oxygen atom:  

$$C_2H_5OH$$


Alcohol is depressant that slows down brain function and affects coordination. 

The exact date of alcohol discovery is uncertain, but evidence suggests it has been produced and consumed by humans for thousands of years, with some of the earliest evidence dating back to around 7000 to 6600 BCE in China.

- History of alcohol
- 

A unit of alcohol is a standardized measure used to quantify the amount of pure alcohol in a drink. The concept of a "unit" of alcohol was introduced by the British government as a means of promoting responsible drinking and providing clear guidelines for alcohol consumption.

In the UK, one unit of alcohol is defined as 10 milliliters (ml) or 8 grams of pure alcohol. Other countries have other definitions, but they broadly align. 

This is roughly equivalent to:

- A single shot (25 ml) of spirits (40% alcohol by volume).
- Half a pint (about 285 ml) of regular strength beer (around 4% alcohol by volume).
- A small glass (125 ml) of wine (around 12% alcohol by volume).

You can see a list of common drink formats and their equivalent units below:

## How Alcohol Works

Alcohol is water and fat-soluble, allowing it to easily enter all cells and tissues in the body. When ingested, it is converted to the toxic substance acetaldehyde before being metabolized into acetate.

## Health Risks of Alcohol



Each daily drink (10-12 g alcohol) is associated with a 4-13% increase in breast cancer risk in women, likely due to effects on estrogen.

Alcohol kills beneficial gut bacteria and increases inflammation in the gut-liver-brain axis. This gut disruption is one factor that leads to cravings for more alcohol.

Ingesting alcohol, even in small amounts, increases cortisol release and stress when not drinking. This can lower the threshold for anxiety between drinking episodes.

In the context of this podcast, "chronic alcohol intake at low levels" refers to regular, habitual drinking of smaller amounts of alcohol. This is in contrast to binge drinking or heavy alcohol consumption.

Dr. Huberman defines this low-level chronic drinking as consuming on average 1-2 drinks per day, or 7-14 drinks per week. This might look like:

1. Having one drink with dinner each night
2. Having 2-3 drinks every Friday and Saturday night
3. Drinking 3-4 drinks in one sitting once a week

While these drinking patterns may not lead to obvious intoxication or acute alcohol-related problems, they still qualify as chronic alcohol intake. The key here is the regularity and consistency of alcohol consumption over time, even if the amount consumed per occasion is relatively low.

The podcast emphasizes that even this level of habitual drinking can lead to negative effects like changes in brain structure, increased impulsivity, and disrupted mood regulation. This challenges the common belief that only heavy drinking is harmful, and suggests that regular consumption of alcohol, even in moderate amounts, can have cumulative effects on health and behavior over time.

- Disruption of sleep architecture: Even small amounts of alcohol can interfere with the quality of sleep by disrupting REM and deep sleep stages, leading to less restorative sleep.
- Increased cancer risk: Alcohol is a known carcinogen, and regular consumption is associated with an increased risk of various cancers, particularly breast cancer in women. Each additional 10 grams of alcohol consumed per day (roughly one drink) is associated with a 4-13% increase in breast cancer risk.
- Gut microbiome disruption: Alcohol can kill beneficial gut bacteria and lead to intestinal inflammation and "leaky gut." This, in turn, can contribute to a range of health problems and may exacerbate alcohol cravings.
- Hormonal imbalances: Alcohol can interfere with hormone production and balance. In males, it can lead to increased conversion of testosterone to estrogen, potentially causing issues like gynecomastia (breast tissue growth) and decreased libido.
- Neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration: Chronic alcohol use can trigger inflammation in the brain and contribute to the deterioration of brain cells and structures, accelerating cognitive decline.
- Weakened immune system: Alcohol can impair the body's immune response, making individuals more susceptible to infections and diseases.
- Increased risk of accidents and injuries: Alcohol impairs judgment, coordination, and reaction time, increasing the likelihood of accidents, falls, and other injuries.
- Social and psychological consequences: Alcohol misuse can contribute to or worsen mental health issues like depression and anxiety, strain interpersonal relationships, and lead to social and occupational problems.
- Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders: Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can lead to a range of developmental disabilities and birth defects known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs).
- - Liver disease: Long-term alcohol use can lead to a range of liver problems, including fatty liver disease, alcoholic hepatitis, and cirrhosis. These conditions can impair liver function and, in severe cases, lead to liver failure.
- Pancreatitis: Alcohol is a leading cause of pancreatitis, a painful inflammation of the pancreas that can become chronic and lead to serious complications.
- Heart disease: While some studies suggest that light to moderate drinking may have cardioprotective effects, heavy drinking can contribute to high blood pressure, cardiomyopathy (weakening of the heart muscle), and an increased risk of stroke and heart failure.
- Digestive problems: In addition to its effects on the gut microbiome, alcohol can irritate the lining of the stomach and intestines, leading to issues like gastritis, ulcers, and gastrointestinal bleeding.
- Sexual dysfunction: Chronic alcohol use can contribute to sexual problems in both men and women, including erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, and difficulty achieving orgasm.
- Osteoporosis: Alcohol can interfere with the body's ability to absorb calcium and vitamin D, which are essential for maintaining strong bones. Over time, this can lead to an increased risk of osteoporosis and fractures.
- Cognitive impairment and dementia: While the podcast mentions neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, it's worth noting that chronic heavy drinking is a significant risk factor for cognitive impairment and various types of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease.
- Medication interactions: Alcohol can interact with many prescription and over-the-counter medications, altering their effectiveness or causing dangerous side effects.
- Nutritional deficiencies: Alcohol can interfere with the absorption and metabolism of essential nutrients, leading to deficiencies that can impact various aspects of health.

## Alcoholism

## Hangovers

Different types of alcoholic beverages can lead to varying hangover severity, and that this seems to be more related to the "congeners" in the drink rather than the sugar content.

Congeners are substances other than ethanol that are produced during fermentation, and they contribute to the unique taste, aroma, and color of alcoholic beverages. Different drinks have different amounts and types of congeners.

According to the podcast, drinks like vodka, which has fewer congeners, tend to cause less severe hangovers compared to drinks like whiskey or red wine, which have more congeners. This is contrary to the popular belief that sugary drinks (or mixers) are the main culprit behind harsh hangovers.

The podcast also provided a ranked list of drinks based on their likelihood to cause severe hangovers:

1. Vodka and beer cause the least severe hangovers
2. Gin causes slightly more severe hangovers
3. White wine and whiskey cause moderately severe hangovers
4. Rum and red wine cause even more severe hangovers
5. Brandy is most likely to cause the most severe hangovers

## Why Drink Alcohol?

- Social pressure -> Does not have to be negative for sure
- It can fun -> You have fun nights out
- You enjoy it â€” then this can be a decent reason
- 

## The "Best Way" to Drink

- Do not drink regularlly
- Limit the amount of drinks per session
- Eat a heavy meal beforehand with a mix of carbs, fat, 
- Drink water in between drinks 
- Drink a safe environment
- For good reasons/responsibly: Choose occasions for drinking that enhance social interaction and enjoyment rather than using alcohol to cope with negative emotions.
- Don't drink and drive. 
- How to say no:
	- On antibiotics
	- General health reason: trying to stay healthy, or not feeling great
	- you are driving
	- For example, a soda with lime can resemble a gin and tonic.
	- Work commitment
	- Or just be direct: this is not a bad way to live. If people still pressure you, you may want to consider if you need a new set of friends. 
## Common Myths

Alcohol increases stress levels, does not decrease
	- It does not warm you up
	- Drinking more after a hangover?
	- "Coffee sobers you up."Coffee or caffeine cannot sober someone up; it might make a person more alert but does not decrease blood alcohol levels or eliminate impairment.
	- "You can 'sweat out' alcohol to sober up faster.". Exercise doesn't speed up the elimination of alcohol from the body. The liver metabolizes alcohol at a consistent rate regardless of physical activity.
	- "Alcohol improves sleep." While alcohol might help someone fall asleep quicker, it actually disrupts the sleep cycle, particularly REM sleep, leading to poorer quality sleep.
	- "Alcohol is not as harmful if you only drink beer or wine."Alcohol's effect on the body is determined by the total amount of ethanol consumed, not the type of drink. Beer and wine can be just as harmful as spirits if consumed in large quantities.
	- "Eating before bed will absorb alcohol." Eating food can help slow the absorption of alcohol if done before or while drinking, but eating after you've already consumed alcohol won't affect the absorption much.
	- popular belief that sugary drinks (or mixers) are the main culprit behind harsh hangovers.


## notes 


- 63% of violent crimes involve alcohol [^mcmurran]
- Most sexual assaults occur when the victim is drunk, not drugged.[^elsohly]
- One of the most common date rape drugs is alcohol[^medicalnewstoday] [^schwartz]
- 5.3% of all deaths are caused by alcohol [^who]
- Total alcohol per capita consumption in 2016 among male and female drinkers worldwide was on average 19.4 litres of pure alcohol for males and 7.0 litres for females. [^who]
- Define Alcoholism
- Should define Binge Drinking 
	- Binge Drinking: Binge drinking, on the other hand, refers to consuming a large amount of alcohol in a short period of time, typically with the intention of becoming intoxicated. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) defines binge drinking as a pattern of alcohol consumption that brings the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to 0.08% or above. This typically corresponds to:
		- 5 or more drinks for males in about 2 hours
		- 4 or more drinks for females in about 2 hours
- Chronic Drinking
	- Chronic drinking refers to a consistent, habitual pattern of alcohol consumption over an extended period of time. It is often characterized by regular drinking on most days of the week, even if the amount consumed per occasion is relatively low. In the context of the Huberman Lab podcast, chronic drinking is defined as consuming on average 1-2 drinks per day, or 7-14 drinks per week.

Chronic drinking can lead to a range of health problems over time, including liver damage, high blood pressure, and an increased risk of certain cancers. It can also lead to psychological and social consequences, such as depression, anxiety, and relationship problems.
- Intersting graph about binge drinking and alcohol use in the US: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK424850/figure/ch3.f1/
- In general, should consider NOT being to US centric through the entire guide if possible. 
- Some kind of notice about not being against drinking, put to present the evidence and make readers make their own decisions. To profess, not prescribe a specific way of living. 
- Huberman: even just a few drinks (one on a weekday and a few on the weekend) means that you have higher stress hormones.
- Huberman: interesting point about even moderate drinking, that it causes a decrease in top down inhibition and an increase in impulsivity and habitual behavior. also changes in the very neural circuits so that you are more impulsive even when not drinking.
- In males, alcohol increases aromatization of testosterone to estrogen, which may lead to gynecomastia and decreased libido.
	- There is a good quote in Macbeth (I think) about alcohol giving the urgue but not the capcaity or something 

- Huberman: being drunk is actually a poison-induced disruption
- It is full of empty calories
	- And the reason why alcohol is considered empty caloriesis because that entire process is very metabolically costly but there's no real nutritive value of the calories that it creates.
- Brief History of Alcohol, when it was first brewed. 
- Different types of alcohol?
- The fact that it goes right through the blood brain barrier?

	- Definition
	- How many drinks a week?
- Positive effects of alcohol
- What's the right amount to drink? let's not beat around the bush: zero.
- Does not help losing weight, body prioritizes metabolizing alcohol 
	- Alcohol consumption can indeed interfere with fat loss, and this is an important point that was not directly addressed in the Huberman Lab podcast.
	- When alcohol is consumed, it becomes the body's primary fuel source. The body prioritizes the metabolism of alcohol over other nutrients, including fat, because it cannot store alcohol and must work to eliminate it from the system. This is known as the "alcohol metabolism priority."
	- During this process, the body's normal fat-burning mechanisms are essentially put on hold. The liver, which is responsible for metabolizing alcohol, is also the primary site for fat metabolism. When the liver is busy processing alcohol, it cannot effectively metabolize fat, leading to a decrease in fat oxidation.
	- Furthermore, alcohol provides "empty" calories, meaning it contains calories (7 calories per gram) but no essential nutrients. These additional calories can contribute to weight gain or hinder weight loss efforts, especially when consumed in excess or in combination with sugary mixers or high-calorie snacks.
	- Alcohol can also indirectly impact fat loss by influencing appetite and food choices. It can lower inhibitions and lead to overeating or making less healthy food choices, further contributing to excess calorie intake.
	- While occasional, moderate alcohol consumption may not significantly derail fat loss efforts, regular or excessive drinking can certainly make it more challenging to achieve and maintain a healthy body composition. Those looking to optimize fat loss may benefit from reducing or eliminating alcohol intake in favor of nutrient-dense, lower-calorie alternatives.

- "Severely dependent drinkers are often able to tolerate very high levels of alcohol inÂ amounts that would dangerously affect or even killÂ some people."[nhs]
- A unit of alcohol is 8g or 10ml of pure alcohol[^nhs], which isÂ about:
	- half a pint of lower to normal-strength lager/beer/cider (ABV 3.6%)
	- a single small shot measure (25ml) of spirits (25ml, ABV 40%)
	- A small glass (125ml, ABV 12%) of wine contains about 1.5 units of alcohol.
