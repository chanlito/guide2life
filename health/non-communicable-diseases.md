# Non-Communicable Diseases.

Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), also known as chronic diseases, are medical conditions that are not transmissible from person to person. NCDs are the leading cause of death globally, accounting for 74% of all deaths worldwide [1].

These diseases are typically long-lasting and progress slowly over time, resulting in a long painful death. 

The four main types of NCDs are:

1. **Cardiovascular diseases**: Conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels, such as heart attacks and stroke.
2. **Cancers**: Diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells in the body.
3. **Chronic respiratory diseases**: Conditions affecting the lungs and airways, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
4. **Diabetes**: A metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar levels resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both.


## **Why NCDs Matter**
NCDs not only affect your own quality of life but also have significant economic impacts on families, communities, and healthcare systems. Contrary to popular belief, NCDs are not just a problem for wealthy, developed countries; they disproportionately affect low- and middle-income countries, where over three-quarters of global NCD deaths occur.

NCDs also eat up the majority of healthcare dollars. For instance, in the US it is 90% of the healthcare budget[2] and in the EU is is 80%[3]. This is growing and clearly not sustainable.

Given the substantial financial burden that NCDs place on healthcare systems and societies, it can be argued that looking after your health is not only a personal responsibility but also a civic duty. By adopting healthy lifestyles and reducing the risk of developing NCDs, you contribute to the sustainability of healthcare systems and the overall well-being of your community.

## Your responsibility. 

While genetic factors do play a role in the likelihood of you developing an NCD, lifestyle choices and habits — _the things that you control_ — are the primary drivers of these diseases. 

The main modifiable risk factors for NCDs include:

1. **Unhealthy diet:** Diets high in saturated and trans fats, added sugars, and salt can increase the risk of NCDs.
2. **Physical inactivity:** Insufficient physical activity and sedentary behavior are linked to increased risk of NCDs.
3. **Tobacco:** Smoking and exposure to second-hand smoke are major risk factors for NCDs, particularly cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and chronic respiratory diseases.
4. **Alcohol:** Excessive alcohol consumption can lead to a range of NCDs, including liver disease and some types of cancer.

_These are all under your control_, and so you can significantly reduce your risk of developing NCDs.
