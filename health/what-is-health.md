# What is Health?

You will die.

However, you can significantly influence the quality of your life before you die. 

Health is both about extending the length and quality of your life. In other words, optimizing the amount of quality-time in your life. There’s no point living until 110 years old, if for the years after 80 you’re just vegetable.
