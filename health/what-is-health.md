# What is Health?

You will die — this is an inevitable truth that every human being must face. 

While you may not be able to escape mortality, you can significantly influence the length and quality of your life through the choices you make and the actions you take.

**Health is both about extending the length and quality of your life.** 

In other words, optimizing the amount of quality-time in your life. There’s no point living until 110 years old, if for the years after 80 you’re just vegetable.

Everything else being equal, more quality-time is better. You get to have more of the precious resource, time. You have more experiences.
