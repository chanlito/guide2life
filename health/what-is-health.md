# What is Health?

You will die — this is an inevitable truth that every human being must face. 

While you may not be able to escape mortality, you can significantly influence the length and quality of your life through the choices you make and the actions you take.

**Health is both about extending the length and quality of your life.** 

In other words, optimizing the amount of quality-time in your life. There’s no point living until 110 years old, if for the years after 80 you’re just vegetable.

Everyone wants more time, except perhaps the person sitting in a prison cell. And if you’re living a miserable life, more time is the last thing you need. But, assuming you have your life in order, more time is better than less time.
