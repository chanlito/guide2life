# Losing Weight.

>[!WARNING] ⚠️ A Note on Misinformation
> The topic of weight loss is plagued by widespread misinformation, often perpetuated by fad diets, misleading marketing claims, and unsubstantiated advice. To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the information presented here, this page includes a significant number of references to peer-reviewed scientific studies and reputable sources. We encourage readers to approach weight loss information with a critical eye and to prioritize evidence-based strategies over popular trends or anecdotal advice.

Achieving and maintaining a healthy weight is a common goal, with benefits for physical health, self-confidence, and overall quality of life. However, the abundance of fad diets, conflicting advice, and misleading marketing claims can make weight loss a confusing and frustrating endeavor.

Let's start by clarifying that when we say "losing weight', we mean losing fat. 

## The Problem with Diets
Research suggests that 95% of diets fail, with most people regaining the weight they lost within a few years or months (Mann et al., 2007). Fad diets often promise rapid weight loss through strict rules and limited food choices, but these diets are difficult to maintain long-term and can lead to feelings of deprivation, frustration, and eventual abandonment (Dulloo & Montani, 2015).

The reason is that the body adapts to calorie restriction by slowing down metabolism and increasing feelings of hunger, making it difficult to sustain the calorie deficit necessary for continued weight loss (Fung, 2016).

When you drastically reduce your calorie intake, your body perceives this as a potential threat to survival and activates a series of adaptive mechanisms to conserve energy (Müller & Bosy-Westphal, 2013). These adaptations include:

- Decreased resting metabolic rate: Your body starts burning fewer calories at rest to conserve energy (Rosenbaum & Leibel, 2010).
- Increased hunger and appetite: Hormonal changes, such as increased levels of ghrelin (the "hunger hormone") and decreased levels of leptin (the "satiety hormone"), lead to increased feelings of hunger and cravings (Sumithran et al., 2011).
- Reduced non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT): Your body unconsciously reduces energy expenditure through fidgeting, postural changes, and other small movements (Rosenbaum et al., 2003).

As a result of these adaptations, you may experience a plateau in weight loss despite maintaining a calorie deficit. To continue losing weight, you would need to further reduce your calorie intake, which can lead to feelings of deprivation, fatigue, and frustration. This cycle of constantly cutting calories and battling hunger is one of the main reasons why many people find it challenging to sustain long-term weight loss through calorie restriction alone.

Moreover, severe calorie restriction can lead to the loss of lean muscle mass, which further slows down metabolism and makes it easier to regain weight once you return to your normal eating habits (Cava et al., 2017).

>[!CAUTION] ⛔️  The Universality of Human Biology
> Humans share the vast majority  (99.9%) of their DNA (Rosenberg et al., 2002). This means that, despite the trend of personalized diets, our bodies react in remarkably consistent ways to similar dietary approaches (Ioannidis, 2013). For example, if we were to hypothetically give any person a pill that stops their body from producing insulin, they would experience rapid weight loss, regardless of their individual characteristics (Frandsen & Svensson, 2021).

## Calories In vs. Calories Out

At its core, weight loss is governed by the law of thermodynamics, which states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or converted (Hall et al., 2012). In the context of weight management, this means that to lose weight, you must consume fewer calories than you burn - a concept known as "calories in vs. calories out" (CICO).

However, while CICO is the ultimate determinant of weight loss, it's not the only factor at play. Hormones, particularly insulin, also have a significant impact on fat storage and fat loss.

## The Role of Insulin
Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that regulates blood sugar levels and plays a crucial role in fat storage. When you eat, especially carbohydrates, your blood sugar levels rise, and insulin is released to shuttle the glucose into your cells for energy or storage (Petersen & Shulman, 2018).

Insulin is often referred to as the "gatekeeper" of fat storage. High levels of insulin promote fat storage, while low levels of insulin allow for fat burning (Dimitriadis et al., 2011). This is why individuals with Type 1 Diabetes, who cannot produce insulin, can lose weight rapidly and face life-threatening complications if not treated with insulin injections, regardless of how much they eat (Frandsen & Svensson, 2021).


## Optimal Fat Loss Strategy

- 95% of diets fail
- CAlories in vs CAlories out is the ultimate thing, linked to the law of thermodynamics.
- However, hormones are just as important, and discuss the role of insulin as the gatekeeper to fat storage and fat loss. Give the example that a Type I Diabetic, no matter how much they eat, will lose weight and die.

While individual differences can play a role in weight loss, it's essential not to overemphasize their importance. Despite the current trend of highly personalized diets, the reality is that we are all human, sharing the vast majority of our DNA, and our bodies react in remarkably similar ways to the same dietary approaches (Ioannidis, 2013).

This is particularly evident when considering the role of insulin in weight regulation. Insulin is a fundamental hormone that operates consistently across the human species. If we were to hypothetically give any person a pill that stops their body from producing insulin, they would experience rapid weight loss, regardless of their individual characteristics (Frandsen & Svensson, 2021). This demonstrates the universal importance of insulin in fat storage and fat burning.

While factors such as genetics, age, sex, and lifestyle can influence the speed and ease of weight loss, the underlying principles remain the same for everyone. A diet that reduces insulin levels, such as a low-carbohydrate diet or intermittent fasting, will promote fat burning and weight loss in the vast majority of people (Westman et al., 2007; Mattson et al., 2017).

Therefore, while it's important to consider individual preferences and sustainability when choosing a weight loss approach, it's equally crucial to recognize the fundamental biological mechanisms that we all share. By focusing on strategies that work with these universal mechanisms, such as optimizing insulin levels, we can develop effective and widely applicable approaches to weight loss and improved health.
